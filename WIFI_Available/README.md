This small flow scans the available wifis. The user enters the wanted wifi SSID, which should trigger a notification. A notification is triggered if the wanted  SSID is scanned . The flow saves the state. If the user left the area where the SSID is available, a different notification is posted and the state is updated. A user can replace the notification blocks with other automations.

This flow is available under https://github.com/MaKaNu/Automate-Flows

Any Issue with this flow can be opened under https://github.com/MaKaNu/Automate-Flows/issues
